# This cfg cannot be enabled, but it still forces Cargo to keep serde_derive's
# version in lockstep with serde's, even if someone depends on the two crates
# separately with serde's "derive" feature disabled. Every serde_derive release
# is compatible with exactly one serde release because the generated code
# involves nonpublic APIs which are not bound by semver.

### FEATURES #################################################################

[features]
default = ["std", "result"]

# Provide impls for common standard library types like Vec<T> and HashMap<K, V>.
# Requires a dependency on the Rust standard library.
std = []

# Provide impls for types that require unstable functionality. For tracking and
# discussion of unstable functionality please refer to this issue:
#
#    https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/812
unstable = []

# Provide impls for types in the Rust core allocation and collections library
# including String, Box<T>, Vec<T>, and Cow<T>. This is a subset of std but may
# be enabled without depending on all of std.
alloc = []

# Opt into impls for Rc<T> and Arc<T>. Serializing and deserializing these types
# does not preserve identity and may result in multiple copies of the same data.
# Be sure that this is what you want before enabling this feature.
rc = []

# Provide impls for Result<T, E>. Convenient in some contexts but can lead to
# confusion if ? or unwrap are used incautiously.
result = []
