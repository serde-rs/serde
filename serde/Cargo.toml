### FEATURES #################################################################

[features]
default = ["std"]

# Provide derive(Serialize, Deserialize) macros.
derive = ["serde_derive"]

# Provide impls for common standard library types like Vec<T> and HashMap<K, V>.
# Requires a dependency on the Rust standard library.
std = []

# Provide impls for types that require unstable functionality. For tracking and
# discussion of unstable functionality please refer to this issue:
#
#    https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/812
unstable = []

# Provide impls for types in the Rust core allocation and collections library
# including String, Box<T>, Vec<T>, and Cow<T>. This is a subset of std but may
# be enabled without depending on all of std.
alloc = []

# Opt into impls for Rc<T> and Arc<T>. Serializing and deserializing these types
# does not preserve identity and may result in multiple copies of the same data.
# Be sure that this is what you want before enabling this feature.
rc = []
